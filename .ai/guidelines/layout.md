## How to Use This File

When starting a new project, populate this file with:

1. **Layout Philosophy** - The overall design approach (minimal, editorial, bold, etc.)
2. **Grid System** - Column structure, split ratios, breakpoint behavior
3. **Section Patterns** - ASCII diagrams of common section layouts
4. **Spacing Strategy** - How negative space is used
5. **Special Effects** - Parallax, overlaps, animations if applicable
6. **Responsive Rules** - How layouts adapt across breakpoints

---

## Layout Philosophy

_Define the design approach for this project:_

- Style: (e.g., minimal, editorial, asymmetric, corporate, playful)
- Key characteristics:
- Visual priorities:

---

## Grid System

_Define the grid structure:_

- Base grid: (e.g., 12-column)
- Common split ratios:
- Breakpoint behavior:

---

## Section Patterns

_Add ASCII diagrams of common section layouts used in this project:_

```
Example pattern:
+----------------------------------------------------+
|                                                    |
|         [ HEADLINE ]                               |
|         [ Subhead ]                                |
|                                                    |
|         [ CTA ]                                    |
|                                                    |
+----------------------------------------------------+
```

## Spacing Strategy

_Define how spacing and negative space are used:_

- Section padding:
- Content margins:
- Negative space philosophy:

---

## Special Effects

_Document any special layout effects:_

- Parallax: (yes/no, layers, speeds)
- Overlapping elements: (rules, z-index strategy)
- Animations: (entrance, scroll-triggered)

---

## Responsive Considerations

_Define how layouts adapt:_

| Breakpoint | Approach |
|------------|----------|
| Mobile | |
| Tablet | |
| Desktop | |

---

## Anti-Patterns

_List layout patterns to avoid in this project:_

| Don't | Why | Do Instead |
