# Archive Directory

This folder contains completed or deprecated plans and documentation.

Move files here when:
- A plan has been fully implemented
- Documentation is no longer relevant but worth preserving
- Features have been removed but history is useful

Naming convention: Keep original filename, optionally prefix with date (YYYY-MM-DD-).
